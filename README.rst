Django Cleanup
**************
|Version| |Status| |License|

Features
========
The django-cleanup app automatically deletes files for :code:`FileField`, :code:`ImageField` and
subclasses. When a :code:`FileField`'s value is changed and the model is saved, the old file is
deleted. When a model that has a :code:`FileField` is deleted, the file is also deleted. A file that
is set as the :code:`FileField`'s default value will not be deleted.

Compatibility
-------------
- This app follows Django's `supported versions`_ and `Python version support`_.
- Compatible with `sorl-thumbnail <https://github.com/jazzband/sorl-thumbnail>`_
- Compatible with `easy-thumbnail <https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails>`_

How does it work?
=================
In order to track changes of a :code:`FileField` and facilitate file deletions, django-cleanup
connects :code:`post_init`, :code:`pre_save`, :code:`post_save` and :code:`post_delete` signals to
signal handlers for each :code:`INSTALLED_APPS` model that has a :code:`FileField`. In order to tell
whether or not a :code:`FileField`'s value has changed a local cache of original values is kept on
the model instance. If a condition is detected that should result in a file deletion, a function to
delete the file is setup and inserted into the commit phase of the current transaction.

**Warning! Please be aware of the known limitations documented below!**

Installation
============
::

    pip install django-cleanup


Configuration
=============
Add ``django_cleanup`` to the bottom of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``

.. code-block:: py

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig',
    )

That is all, no other configuration is necessary.

Note: Order of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is important. To ensure that exceptions inside other apps' signal
handlers do not affect the integrity of file deletions within transactions, ``django_cleanup``
should be placed last in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Troubleshooting
===============
If you notice that ``django-cleanup`` is not removing files when expected, check that your models
are being properly
`loaded <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/applications/#how-applications-are-loaded>`_:

    You must define or import all models in your application's models.py or models/__init__.py.
    Otherwise, the application registry may not be fully populated at this point, which could cause
    the ORM to malfunction.

If your models are not loaded, ``django-cleanup`` will not be able to discover their
``FileField``'s.

You can check if your ``Model`` is loaded by using

.. code-block:: py

    from django.apps import apps
    apps.get_models()

Known limitations
=================

Database should support transactions
------------------------------------
If you are using a database that does not support transactions you may lose files if a
transaction will rollback at the right instance. This outcome is mitigated by our use of
post_save and post_delete signals, and by following the recommended configuration in this README.
This outcome will still occur if there are signals registered after app initialization and there are
exceptions when those signals are handled. In this case, the old file will be lost and the new file
will not be referenced in a model, though the new file will likely still exist on disk. If you are
concerned about this behavior you will need another solution for old file deletion in your project.

File referenced by multiple model instances
-------------------------------------------
This app is designed with the assumption that each file is referenced only once. If you are sharing
a file over two or more model instances you will not have the desired functionality. Be cautious of
copying model instances, as this will cause a file to be shared by more than one instance. If you
want to reference a file from multiple models add a level of indirection. That is, use a separate
file model that is referenced from other models through a foreign key. There are many file
management apps already available in the django ecosystem that fulfill this behavior.

Advanced
========
This section contains additional functionality that can be used to interact with django-cleanup for
special cases.

Signals
-------
To facilitate interactions with other django apps django-cleanup sends the following signals which
can be imported from :code:`django_cleanup.signals`:

- :code:`cleanup_pre_delete`: just before a file is deleted. Passes a :code:`file` keyword argument.
- :code:`cleanup_post_delete`: just after a file is deleted. Passes a :code:`file` keyword argument.

Signals example for sorl.thumbnail:

.. code-block:: py

    from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete
    from sorl.thumbnail import delete

    def sorl_delete(**kwargs):
        delete(kwargs['file'])

    cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)

Refresh the cache
-----------------
There have been rare cases where the cache would need to be refreshed. To do so the
:code:`django_cleanup.cleanup.refresh` method can be used:

.. code-block:: py

    from django_cleanup import cleanup

    cleanup.refresh(model_instance)

Ignore cleanup for a specific model
-----------------------------------
To ignore a model and not have cleanup performed when the model is deleted or its files change, use
the :code:`ignore` decorator to mark that model:

.. code-block:: py

    from django_cleanup import cleanup

    @cleanup.ignore
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        image = models.FileField()

Only cleanup selected models
----------------------------
If you have many models to ignore, or if you prefer to be explicit about what models are selected,
you can change the mode of django-cleanup to "select mode" by using the select mode app config. In
your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting you will replace ':code:`django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig`'
with ':code:`django_cleanup.apps.CleanupSelectedConfig`'. Then use the :code:`select` decorator to
mark a model for cleanup:

.. code-block:: py

    from django_cleanup import cleanup

    @cleanup.select
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        image = models.FileField()

How to run tests
================
Install, setup and use pyenv_ to install all the required versions of cPython
(see the `tox.ini <https://github.com/un1t/django-cleanup/blob/master/tox.ini>`_).

Setup pyenv_ to have all versions of python activated within your local django-cleanup repository.
Ensuring that the latest supported python version that was installed is first priority.

Install tox_ on the latest supported python version and run the :code:`tox` command from your local
django-cleanup repository.

How to write tests
==================
This app requires the use of django.test.TransactionTestCase_ when writing tests.

For details on why this is required see `here
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/transactions/#use-in-tests>`_:

    Django's :code:`TestCase` class wraps each test in a transaction and rolls back that transaction
    after each test, in order to provide test isolation. This means that no transaction is ever
    actually committed, thus your :code:`on_commit()` callbacks will never be run. If you need to
    test the results of an :code:`on_commit()` callback, use a :code:`TransactionTestCase` instead.

pytest
------
When writing tests with pytest_ use `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)`_ with the
:code:`transaction` argument set to :code:`True` to ensure that the behavior will be the same as 
using a transaction test case.
