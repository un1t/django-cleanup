Features
========
The django-cleanup app automatically deletes files for :code:`FileField`, :code:`ImageField` and
subclasses. When a :code:`FileField`'s value is changed and the model is saved, the old file is
deleted. When a model that has a :code:`FileField` is deleted, the file is also deleted. A file that
is set as the :code:`FileField`'s default value will not be deleted.

Compatibility
-------------
- Django 1.11, 2.1, 2.2 (`See Django Supported Versions <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions>`_)
- Python 2.7 and 3.4+
- Compatible with `sorl-thumbnail <https://github.com/jazzband/sorl-thumbnail>`_
- Compatible with `easy-thumbnail <https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails>`_

How does it work?
=================
In order to track changes of a :code:`FileField` and facilitate file deletions, django-cleanup
connects :code:`post_init`, :code:`pre_save`, :code:`post_save` and :code:`post_delete` signals to
signal handlers for each :code:`INSTALLED_APPS` model that has a :code:`FileField`. In order to tell
whether or not a :code:`FileField`'s value has changed a local cache of original values is kept on
the model instance. If a condition is detected that should result in a file deletion, a function to
delete the file is setup and inserted into the commit phase of the current transaction.

**Warning! If you are using a database that does not support transactions you may lose files if a
transaction will rollback at the right instance. Though this outcome is mitigated by our use of
post_save and post_delete signals, this outcome will still occur if there are errors in signals that
are handled after our signals are handled. In this case, the old file will be lost and the new file
will not be referenced in a model, though the new file will likely still exist on disk. If you are
concerned about this behavior you will need another solution for old file deletion in your
project.**

Installation
============
::

    pip install django-cleanup


Configuration
=============
Add django_cleanup to settings.py
::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig',
    )

That is all, no other configuration is necessary.

Advanced
========
This section contains additional functionality that can be used to interact with django-cleanup for
special cases.

Signals
-------
To facilitate interactions with other django apps django-cleanup sends the following signals which
can be imported from :code:`django_cleanup.signals`:

- :code:`cleanup_pre_delete`: just before a file is deleted. Passes a :code:`file` keyword argument.
- :code:`cleanup_post_delete`: just after a file is deleted. Passes a :code:`file` keyword argument.

Signals example for sorl.thumbnail:
::

    from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete
    from sorl.thumbnail import delete

    def sorl_delete(**kwargs):
        delete(kwargs['file'])

    cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)

Refresh the cache
-----------------
There have been rare cases where the cache would need to be refreshed. To do so the
:code:`django_cleanup.cleanup.refresh` method can be used:
::

    from django_cleanup import cleanup

    cleanup.refresh(model_instance)

Ignore cleanup for a specific model
-----------------------------------
Ignore a model and do not perform cleanup when the model is deleted or its files change.
::

    from django_cleanup import cleanup

    @cleanup.ignore
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        image = models.FileField()

How to run tests
================
Install, setup and use pyenv_ to install all the required versions of cPython
(see the `tox.ini <https://github.com/un1t/django-cleanup/blob/master/tox.ini>`_).

Setup pyenv_ to have all versions of python activated within your local django-cleanup repository.
Ensuring that the python 2.7 that was installed is first priority.

Install tox_ on python 2.7 and run the :code:`tox` command from your local django-cleanup
repository.

How to write tests
==================
This app requires the use of django.test.TransactionTestCase_ when writing tests.

For details on why this is required see `here
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/transactions/#use-in-tests>`_:

    Djangoâ€™s :code:`TestCase` class wraps each test in a transaction and rolls back that transaction
    after each test, in order to provide test isolation. This means that no transaction is ever
    actually committed, thus your :code:`on_commit()` callbacks will never be run. If you need to
    test the results of an :code:`on_commit()` callback, use a :code:`TransactionTestCase` instead.
